Some things about Windows and the recycle bin in an Enterprise Domain.

1. Each user's Recycle Bin is located in a hidden folder at | Fill in File Path |.  
2. Their naming convention follows a pattern | Fill in Naming Convention |.
3. Each user only has permissions to their own Recycle Bin and should ony affect their own.
4. By default the Recycle Bin has a maximum percentage of the hard drive, which is regulated by Group Policy.

The following is a break down of the various components of the scrypt.

# First 3 lines up to the Pipe, pull the SID of the currently logge on user.
# After Pipe, passes that output to the variable $_.
# Creates Variable $RemoveRecycleBin witht eh path for the logged on user's recycle bin with thier SID.
# Pulls drive information and packages up a variable for the current user's $Recycle.Bin
# Pulls anything over 30 days since last write time and deletes it.
